# TODO

Very simple todo app

- Backend - SpringBoot
- UI - React
  - tailwind for style

## More to come

Plan is to build out UI, then backend, then dockerize the whole shebang


## Right now though
* Got basic UI and integration with backend working
* Working to see if RTK or React Query is a better method of integrating with backend
* Switch to Typescript eventually
