# TODO

Very simple todo app

- Backend - SpringBoot
- UI - React
  - tailwind for style

## More to come

Plan is to build out UI, then backend, then dockerize the whole shebang

## Right now though

__In progress__

- Working to see if RTK or React Query is a better method of integrating with backend
- Switch to Typescript eventually

_Complete_

- Got basic UI and integration with backend working
